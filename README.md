## TypeScript Journey

This repo is a collection of my practice code for learning TypeScript.
This is an ongoing project and I will be adding more code as I learn more.

I hope this would be helpful for anyone who is learning TypeScript.
I'd categorize the code in this repo as follows:

-   Basic Level
-   Intermediate Level
-   Advanced Level
