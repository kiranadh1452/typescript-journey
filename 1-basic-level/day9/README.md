## Topic Covered : Declaration Files in TypeScript

Declaration files are those with the extension `.d.ts`. They are used to describe the shape of an object that is defined outside of the current project. For example, if you are using a library that is written in JavaScript, you can use a decorator file to describe the shape of the objects that are defined in that library.
